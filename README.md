# 8bit-led-count
8-bit binary counter which displays as LED high output.

To run the code, simply fork the repo, download the .ino file and upload it to your own Arduino (or equivalently C driven micro-controller.)

Number of iterations of counting is delimited by how many LEDs one has hooked up to the circuit.

For instance, this 8bit counter only counts to 256 in binary (2^# of LEDs), but the code and circuit could 
easily be modified to accomodate a higher count cieling. 

Written in C for Arduino. See it in action here: https://youtu.be/WG22eX62WrI
