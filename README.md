# 8bit-led-count
8-bit binary counter which displays as LED high output.

Number of iterations of counting is delimited by how many LEDs one has hooked up to the circuit.

For instance, this 8bit counter only counts to 256 in binary (2^# of LEDs), but the code and circuit could 
easily be modified to accomodate a higher count cieling.
